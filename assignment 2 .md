Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software engineering-it is the process of designing, developing,testing and maintainance of software applications.
Software engineering is concerned with the software development cycle while traditional programming is concerned the process of writing code for specific purposes.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
These are structured steps that one can follow to ensure high quality software systems are invented.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
a.Planning and analysis -entails preparation and examination of the problem.
b.Define requirements -gather user requirements.
c.Design -entails coming up with drawings.
d.Development-entails writing code and removing bugs.
e.Testing -entails ensuring that the software works as it should. e.g component testing,sytem testing and acceptance testing.
f.Deployment -entails rolling out software.
g.Maintenance -entails bug fixing.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Agile model is used when one requires flexibility as it enables change when needed while waterfall is a model that requires one to know whats needed as next step can only be done when step before it is completed.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Key difference: Agile enables adaptability while waterfall is plan driven.
example of waterfall -hospital system as it requires very structured development cycle.
example of agile -when dealing with beginners in programming may help them go back and forth  when developing software.

Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering? 
Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Process of identifying,analyzing, specifying,validating and managing system requirements.
process:
a. Inception - understanding the problem and nature of the solution.
b. Elicitation- familiarising with important project details.
c. Elaboration - gathered requirements are refined.
d. Negotiation -determination of priorities of each requirement. 
e. Specification -gathering of functional and non functional requirements.
f. verification and Validation -ensuring system is built to customers requirements and ensuring software implements the right functions.
g. Requirement engineering
Importance of requirement engineering is that it informs  everyone involved in a project what ought to be done.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity is a design principle that aims to reduce dependencies between system components.
It improves maintainability by ensuring that the code is organized, can be re-used and thus easy to manage
and scalability as it breaks software into independent modules which can easily be extended, replaced and made to easily adapt.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
a. Unit testing - Testing a small part of the software.
b. Integration testing - Components of software are slowly combined and tested as a group.
c. System testing - Test the whole system.
d. Acceptance testing - Testing with customer data to check if it meets user requirement.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control systems - software tools that assist software teams to manage changes that occur in source code over a period of time.
It is important as it enables improved code quality due to continued peer reviews.
examples:                features
a. GitHub               - local branching, multiple workflows, convenient staging areas.
b. Beanstalk            - uses browser and cloud.
c. Gitlab               -project website, integrsted project.
d. Apache subversion    -inventory management, security management, history tracking.

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software managers role is to ensure successful completion of projects.
Responsibilities: 
a.writes project proposal
b.cost estimations
c.scheduling
d.project staffing  
e.risk management 
f. miscellaneous plans.
challenges
a. Inadequate skills for efficient project management.
b.undefined goals due to hardship in defining goals.
c. Poor communication- between the manager and his/her team.
d. Unmanageable deadlines- deadlines may be too close for adequate and effective completion of project.
e.lack of accountability -by the team he/she is managing could affect the quality of software being developed.

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintenance -process of altering, modifying and updating software to ensure it continues suiting customer needs.
Maintenance activities:
a. Corrective - done to make the software error-free.
b. Adaptive -enables software to remain relevant in the current time.
c. Preventive -done to avoid problems.
d. Perfective  -done so as to enhance software attributes.
software maintenance is important as it aids in general improvement of the software as it enables removal of bugs leading to improved performance.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
ethical issues:
a. corporate ownership of personal data- how users personal data is used by the corporate companies.
b. Addictive design -based on nature of benefit to users using the software as it may benefit company but negatively benefit consumer.
c. overemphasize on features- some developers focus so much on some features and fotget other features.
d. security issues -enatila cybesecurity challenges such as hacking and denial of service.
e. biasness in algorithms -some developers let their own self believes cloud their choice in algorithm which may disatisfy users.
Adhearance:
a. Ensuring that they act with no bias- during  advising, interviewing or offering services.
b. Comply with the lawas that govern software engineering.
c. Ensure that they protect the identities of their users and their personal data.
d. Ensure to maintain transparency in their day to day practises.
e. Ensure equitable access - should not be tribal or have any favourism towards any gender, status, religion or nationality when offering their software.
